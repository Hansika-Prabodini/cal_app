# Matrix Inverse Calculator (cal_app)

## Overview

The **cal_app** project is a multi-component repository containing tools for mathematical computations, simulations, and machine learning configurations. The centerpiece is a Python-based GUI application for calculating matrix inverses, complemented by statistical simulation scripts, utility functions, and ML model training configurations.

## Project Components

### 1. Matrix Inverse Calculator GUI (Python)
A Tkinter-based graphical interface for computing matrix inverses with support for 2×2 to 5×5 matrices. Features an intuitive input grid, real-time computation, and clear result display.

**→ See [README2.md](README2.md) for detailed documentation**

### 2. Random Walk Simulation (R)
An R script (`RW1.R`) that simulates survival probability in a random walk scenario with configurable parameters including steps, population size, and directional probabilities.

### 3. Java Utilities
A Java utility class (`Utils.java`) providing helper methods for various operations.

### 4. Configuration Files
YAML configuration file (`default_config.yaml`) for machine learning model training, including settings for model parameters, LoRA fine-tuning, and data paths.
