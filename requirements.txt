# Python Requirements File
# ========================
# This project requires Python 3.x (3.6 or higher recommended for tkinter compatibility)
#
# Current Status:
# - The codebase currently uses only Python standard library modules
# - Main dependencies: tkinter (GUI), unittest (testing)
# - These are included with standard Python distributions
#
# Future Dependencies:
# - This file is ready for addition of external dependencies as the project grows
# - Common scientific computing libraries that may be added:
#   - numpy (for matrix operations)
#   - scipy (for advanced numerical computations)
#
# Usage:
# - Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
# - Currently: No external packages to install

# External dependencies (none yet)
# Add new dependencies below as needed, e.g.:
# numpy>=1.20.0
# scipy>=1.7.0
